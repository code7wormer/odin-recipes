    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups (437g) bread flour (plus extra for kneading)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (plus extra for the bowl)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Your choice of toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives)</li>
        <li>Optional: Red pepper flakes, oregano for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Activate Yeast: In a large bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
        <li>Mix Dough: Add the flour, olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon or a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment until the dough starts to come together.</li>
        <li>Knead: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-8 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer on low speed for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>First Rise: Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in it, and turn it over to coat. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat Oven: While the dough rises, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven now.</li>
        <li>Shape Dough: Once risen, punch down the dough gently. Divide it in half for two medium pizzas. On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll one half into your desired pizza shape (about 12 inches in diameter).</li>
        <li>Add Toppings: Transfer the shaped dough to a parchment-lined or floured pizza peel/baking sheet. Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and add your desired toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake: Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven, either onto the hot stone/steel or a baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
